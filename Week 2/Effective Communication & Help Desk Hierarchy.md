## Effective Communication & Troubleshooting Exercise

- The onus is on ourselves to effectively communicate. The first step is through active listening. 
- Have I used active listening to ensure that I received the message clearly?
  - Focus on the other person.
  - Avoid judging or assuming where the conversation will go.
  - If you are preparing your response before the other person has finished speaking, you are not active listening! Don't just wait for your turn to speak! 
  - Avoid interrupting the other person.
  - Respect pauses in the other person's speech - give them time to think about their next thought and articulate it before interjecting.
  - Ask follow up questions to reiterate the issue. 
  - Request clarification when needed.
  - Paraphrase what the other person has said and repeat any key phrases. 
  - Summarize the other persons thought, request, or issue. 
  - Empathize with the other person! Show kindness always! 
- The second facet of effective communication is when we act as the speaker. 
  - Does the other person understand what I have told them?
  - Ask them probing questions to check their understanding.
  - Ask them to summarize what you have told them. 
  - Encourage the other individual to ask any clarifying questions. 
  - Be as concise as possible when speaking while still giving the other individual all they need to understand a concept or issue. 

Luisa is a new L1 call support center associate for FBC. The following is a transcript of her call:

Luisa: Hi this is Luisa at FBC, you've reached the support desk. How may I help you today? 

Caller: Hi, yeah, uhh, I'm Jake. Hey look my computer isn't working. Can you help me? 

Luisa: Of course! What kinds of issues are you having Jake? 

Jake: Well, uhhh, my computer isn't doing anything. I'm moving the mouse and everything is just frozen. 

Luisa: Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Well let me ask you this Jake, is your monitor displaying an image or is it just a black screen? 

Jake: Ummm, yeah I can see things on my monitor just fine. I'm telling you it's my computer that is broken, not the monitor! 

Luisa: I see, thank you for clearing that up for me. Next I'd like to ask about your mouse - is it wireless or does it have a wire plugged into your computer? 

Jake: It has a wire on it. 

Luisa: Okay, it may be tricky to mess with all the wires plugged into your computer - but could you follow the wire on the mouse and make sure it is plugged firmly into your computer? 

Jake: \*Sigh\* Yeah one sec. 

Jake: ....

Jake: Well I feel stupid... I unplugged the mouse and plugged it back in and now it works. 

Luisa: Hey it's happened to me before, and that's fantastic! So just to confirm - you can move your mouse around the screen and nothing is frozen anymore? 

Jake: Yes, thank you! 

Luisa: Your welcome Jake, that is what we are here for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Jake: No, I'm good. 

Luisa: Okay great, it was nice talking to you Jake, have a good day!
