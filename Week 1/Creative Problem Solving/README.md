# Creative Problem Solving
One of the challenges you will face will be how to resolve a customer issue within the confines of your role. There will be things you can do and things you cannot. You will not be able to make everyone totally happy all of the time. Your goal should be to identify the best way to resolve a customer issue without exceeding your authority, making promises you cannot keep, and while keeping the customer as happy as possible. 

A problem or issue can be thought of as a difference between expectation and reality. The customer expected X, but reality is Y. The issue at hand is the difference between X and Y. Can you get them from X to Y? Can you make them understand why Y is not possible? Can you offer them a Z, a compromise?

First, identify the problem. Make sure you fully understand it. Without this, you are working blind and may be wasting both your and the customer's time. 

Once the problem is identified, express it back to the customer in your own words. This will verify that you are both on the same page, and helps express empathy and develop rapport.

```
Keep in mind: Promise is a bad word. You are making a guarantee about things which may be outside your control. Express that sentiment in a different way. For example:
 - "In all likelihood you will get the package within 72 hours."
 - "You should expect someone to reach out to you before the end of the day."
 - "That shouldn't happen, but if it does just call us back and ask for me."
```
Now to solve the problem. If a solution is obvious, then you can resolve it easily. If not, it's time to get creative.

### The Finish Line
Consider the "finish line". What has to happen to resolve this issue? This is what you will work toward. Maybe you cannot give the customer everything they want, what is the minimum the customer needs to have their problem be resolved? Work out loud, if you think of some way to handle the issue, say so: 

"I can send a technician out to your office to have a look at the device. If we can't get it running they will provide a replacement while we work on it."

The customer will certainly voice their opinion about your proposal.

### Boundaries
There are going to be things you cannot offer. Perhaps a customer wants compensation for their trouble that is more than you are able to offer. Perhaps they want a guarantee that the service they pay for will never, ever, experience an outage again. When the customer asks for something you cannot provide, use this as an opportunity to understand what they want, and what you might be able to do for them. 


### Outside the Box
You have a set of tools at your disposal, and they have intended uses. Maybe, however, you can resolve an issue by using a tool in an unexpected fashion. Don't hesitate to use the tools at your disposal in interesting and novel ways. Do give some thought to if this idea goes against policy, best practice, or good sense. When in doubt, ask someone for guidance!




## Exercises
Remember: Identify the problem in terms of expectation vs. reality, and identify the finish line. Engage and offer possible solutions. Keep in mind there are things you cannot do, and look beyond the obvious for solutions.

 - A customer calls because they can no longer access an email inbox their spouse had previously shared with them. For whatever reason, the owner of the inbox no longer wishes to share that resource with this caller. The caller wants you to share the inbox again, or give them the password. You cannot do this. Do your best to explain to the customer why you cannot do this for them, and offer alternative avenues they might pursue. 
 - You have a customer who pays your company for a service they rarely use. Today they went to use the service for the first time in several months and the service was experiencing an outage. The customer makes it clear they want several months of fees refunded to them, as well as a guarantee that this won't happen next time. The best you can offer is a partial refund of the current billing cycle.
 - A customer is calling in distress, they are giving a presentation at this very moment using a device located in the conference room. They just need to get through a few more slides. Important clients are becoming impatient, and this sheds a negative light on your organization. There is a wireless mouse and keyboard but they have stopped responding. You can clearly tell the device itself is still working. Calm the customer, and come up with a creative solution that gets the presentation back on track as quickly as possible.
